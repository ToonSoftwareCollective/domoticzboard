1.1.15/16

- improved handling of blinds

1.1.14
- small change to become compliant with the updated Domoticz API

1.1.13
- change switching scenes (using On/Off calls instead of using the toggle)

1.1.12
- dimmer controls "-" and "+" can now be operated multiple times before sending the new values to Domoticz
  this avoids the one second delay between each button click.
  When no button is clicked for one second, the final command is send to domoticz.
  Please do not operate the buttons for multiple dimmers in one go, as only the last dimmer will be updated

1.1.11
- add support for authentication

1.1.10
- on/off switch is now working as expected for blinds (type 'Blinds Percentage')
  the switch will fully open or close the blinds
- for dimmers (and blinds) the dimlevel can be entered via the keyboard as well instead of the + and - buttons.

1.1.9
- now showing Shelly dimmers

1.1.8
- dimmableColors update

1.1.7
- added support for 'selector' type switches, option to select one of the supported states per selector
  clicking on the selector name will also show the selected option on the tile

1.1.5
- improved handling of dimmer levels, now also support 'builtin' array's with dimlevels

1.1.4
- improved handling of dimmer levels, now in 10 steps from min to max

1.1.3
- dimmer levels can be set, dimmer status is properly shown now

1.1.2
- (Lights) dimmers will be shown as well but can only be set to "on" or "off" state right now

1.1.1
- complete rewrite of the app. No specific config needed for switch idx values.
   The full config is read from domoticz and shown in two lists (switches and groups/scenes)
- clicking on a switch or scene on the main screen will also show add switch/scene to the tile (max 2 switches/scenes)
- new icons are used (need the latest resource file for that - check for updates in the TSC tab in settings)
- user settings are now stored in /mnt/data/tsc (preparing for a nice upcoming feature which I cannot talk about right now :-) ) 

1.0.2
- added an active tile showing switch 1 and switch 2 only.
  you can toggle the switches by clicking on the icons on the tile.
  clicking anywhere else on the tile opens the full domoticzboard screen

1.0.1
- fixed typos for switch 4 and switch 5

1.0.0
- first ToonStore release
